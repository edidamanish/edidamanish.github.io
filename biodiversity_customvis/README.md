# Custom Visualization Design

I created a unique visualization that goes beyond the "common chart types" that already exist.

The audience for this visualization is visitors to a musuem. The goal is to create a visually interesting and informative visualization graphic/infographic exhibit that communicates (some or all of) the dataset effectively and in a creative manner (as opposed to supporting in-depth analysis such as might be done by domain experts).

The dataset chosen for the visualization
* Biodiversity in National Parks ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity)): a database of animal and plant species identified in individual national parks
